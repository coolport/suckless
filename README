Personal builds of the suckless programs dwm and st, patched and configured to work with modern workflows. Perfect for use in minimal install distros. Patched from scratch on version 6.5 (dwm) and 0.9.2 (st). Overview:

dwm - lightly inspired by my previous i3 setup, lots of QoL configs, bindings for special laptop keys, float rules, etc etc. Patched generously which means a lot of conflicts had to be resolved, it works great as a whole.

st - patched to fix old issues like box rendering etc, overall configured for basic qol stuff, look nice, and not get in the way of tmux.

dwmblocks-async - not an official suckless program but serves as the status bar for my system. Most of the work here is in signal handling, properly integrating it with dwm, and stealing / setting up the scripts.
